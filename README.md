# affective-computing
a Persian summary of affective computing book written by Rosalind Picard

Affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects. It is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer science, psychology, and cognitive science. the more modern branch of computer science originated with **Rosalind Picard's 1995** paper on affective computing and her **book Affective Computing** published by **MIT** Press. One of the motivations for the research is the ability to give machines emotional intelligence, including simulating empathy. The machine should interpret the emotional state of humans and adapt its behavior to them, giving an appropriate response to those emotions.
